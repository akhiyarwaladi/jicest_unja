        <section class="text-justify">JICEST aims to bring together researchers, experts, practitioners,
            scholars, and
            students
            to exchange and share their experiences, new ideas, and research results about all aspects of
            engineering, science, and technology in related areas. The conference will be held every year to
            make it
            an ideal platform for people to share views and experiences in engineering, science, and technology.
